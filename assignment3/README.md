Module 3 Coding Assignment
==========================

Solution for assignment 3.

## Notes

This assignment was a bit unclear when regarding structure after it was split
into two different assignments. When in doubt I have followed the assignment
description instead of any conflicting comments in the starter-code files.

## Extra functionality and changes from assignment text
- Using README.md instead of README.txt (for markdown support)
- Various style adjustments
